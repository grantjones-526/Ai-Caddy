## The Problem (15 seconds)
"Every golfer faces the same challenge: standing over a shot, trying to decide which club to use. Do you go with your 7 iron or 8 iron? How does the lie affect your distance? Traditional methods rely on guesswork and memory, leading to inconsistent performance."

2. **Performance Tracking** - Track every round and shot, with detailed statistics showing your average distance for each club from different lies - fairway, rough, and tee box.

3. **GPS Shot Tracking** - Use your phone's GPS to automatically measure shot distances on the course, making data entry seamless.

4. **Launch Monitor Integration** - Import data from popular devices like Garmin R10, SkyTrak+, and Flightscope Mevo+.

5. **Visual Analytics** - Interactive visualizations show how your shots cluster in feature space, helping you understand your game better."
