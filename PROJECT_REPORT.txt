1. PROJECT BACKGROUND
================================================================================

1.1 Problem Statement
--------------------
Golfers face a fundamental challenge when selecting clubs during a round: 
determining which club to use based on distance, lie conditions, hole 
characteristics, and personal playing style. Traditional methods rely on:
- Memory of past performance
- General yardage charts
- Guesswork and intuition
- Trial and error

These approaches lead to inconsistent performance, suboptimal club selection, 
and missed scoring opportunities. The problem is compounded by the fact that 
each golfer has unique swing characteristics, and performance varies 
significantly based on:
- Lie conditions (fairway, rough, tee box, sand)
- Hole characteristics (straight, dogleg left, dogleg right)
- Shot shape preferences (straight, fade, draw, slice, hook)
- Environmental factors

1.2 Market Context
------------------
The golf technology market has seen significant growth with launch monitors, 
GPS devices, and swing analyzers. However, most solutions focus on:
- Swing mechanics analysis
- Ball flight data collection
- Course mapping

Few solutions provide intelligent, personalized club recommendations based on 
historical performance data using machine learning algorithms.

1.3 Solution Overview
--------------------
Ai Caddy addresses this gap by providing an intelligent, data-driven club 
recommendation system that:
- Analyzes historical shot data using machine learning
- Provides personalized recommendations based on current situation
- Tracks performance metrics over time
- Integrates with popular launch monitor devices
- Offers visual analytics for game improvement

================================================================================
2. OBJECTIVE (GOAL)
================================================================================

2.1 Primary Objective
---------------------
Develop a web-based application that uses machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbors 
algorithm) to provide personalized golf club recommendations based on:
- Historical shot performance data
- Current shot parameters (distance, lie, hole bend, shot shape)
- User-specific playing patterns

2.2 Secondary Objectives
------------------------
1. Create a comprehensive shot tracking system for rounds and individual shots
2. Implement data import functionality for multiple launch monitor devices
3. Provide statistical analysis of club performance (averages, consistency)
4. Develop an intuitive, responsive user interface
5. Enable GPS-based shot distance measurement
6. Create visual analytics for shot pattern analysis
7. Deploy application to cloud hosting platform (Render.com)

2.3 Success Criteria
--------------------
- System provides accurate club recommendations with confidence scoring
- Users can track rounds and shots efficiently
- Launch monitor data can be imported from multiple device types
- Application is accessible on desktop and mobile devices
- Database efficiently stores and retrieves shot data

4.2.3 Machine Learning Algorithm
--------------------------------

Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

Features (Input):
1. Distance to hole (numeric, yards)
2. Lie (categorical: Fairway, Rough, Tee Box, Sand) - Label Encoded
3. Hole bend (categorical: Straight, Dogleg Left, Dogleg Right) - Label Encoded
4. Shot shape (categorical: Straight, Fade, Draw, Slice, Hook) - Label Encoded

Target (Output):
- Club name (categorical) - Label Encoded

Algorithm Parameters:
- k (number of neighbors): Dynamic, calculated as max(3, min(10, sqrt(n_samples)))
- weights: 'distance' (closer neighbors have more influence)
- distance metric: Euclidean (default)

Training Process:
1. Collect all historical shots for the user
2. Extract features: distance, lie, bend (inferred from shot_shape), shot_shape
3. Encode categorical features using LabelEncoder
4. Combine features into feature matrix X_train
5. Extract target labels (club names) into y_train
6. Train KNN classifier with distance-weighted voting

Prediction Process:
1. Encode query features (distance, lie, bend, shot_shape)
2. Find k nearest neighbors in feature space
3. Calculate distance-weighted scores for each club
4. Calculate confidence based on neighbor distances
5. Calculate agreement (percentage of neighbors recommending same club)
6. Rank clubs by combined score (probability * agreement * distance_confidence)
7. Filter out Driver if lie is not Tee Box
8. Return top 1-3 recommendations with statistics

Fallback Logic:
- If KNN has no good neighbors (average neighbor distance > 2x query distance):
  - Recommend furthest club(s) in bag based on average distance for the lie
  - Exclude Driver if lie is not Tee Box
  - Mark confidence as "Low"

4.2.4 Data Processing Pipeline
------------------------------

Launch Monitor Import:
1. User uploads CSV or JSON file
2. System detects device type (auto-detect or manual selection)
3. Parser class (LaunchMonitorParser) processes file:
   - CSV: DictReader, row-by-row parsing
   - JSON: json.loads, recursive parsing
4. Normalize data to standard format:
   - Extract: date, course, hole, club, distance
   - Optional: carry distance, launch angle, ball speed, spin rate
   - Infer shot shape from launch direction and distance metrics
5. Group shots by round (date + course)
6. Store raw data and parsed data in LaunchMonitorImport model
7. Preview shown to user for confirmation
8. On confirmation, create GolfRound and Shot objects
9. Update import status and statistics

GPS Shot Tracking:
- JavaScript geolocation API
- Calculate distance between two GPS coordinates
- Update distance input field automatically

4.2.5 Performance Optimizations
-------------------------------

Database Queries:
- Use Django ORM annotations (Avg, StdDev) instead of Python calculations
- Use prefetch_related for related objects
- Filter queries by user to reduce data size

Static Files:

- Compressed static files in production
- CDN for external resources (Google Fonts, Plotly.js)

Caching:

6. CONCLUSION
================================================================================

Ai Caddy successfully implements an AI-powered golf club recommendation system
that addresses the core problem of club selection in golf. The application:

- Provides intelligent, personalized recommendations using machine learning
- Tracks comprehensive shot and round data
- Integrates with multiple launch monitor devices
- Offers statistical analysis and visualizations
- Delivers a responsive, user-friendly interface
- Is deployed and accessible online

The K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm effectively learns from user's historical data
and provides relevant recommendations based on current shot parameters. The
system includes robust error handling, fallback logic, and data validation to
ensure reliability.

Future enhancements could include:
- Weather condition integration
- Course-specific recommendations
- Advanced analytics and trends
- Mobile native applications
- Social features (sharing rounds, leaderboards)
- Integration with more launch monitor devices

The project demonstrates proficiency in:
- Full-stack web development (Django, HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- Machine learning implementation (scikit-learn, KNN)
- Database design and optimization
- API integration (launch monitor parsers)
- Cloud deployment (Render.com)
- Responsive design and UX
